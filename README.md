### About Me

I love to approach things with first principal, anything that has a really complex infrastructure is combination of many simple concepts, decoding it and integrating it is what drives me. Currently I've involved doing the following things. 

* 🌱 **Growth:** Deepening my understanding of **Distributed Systems** to handle model training at scale.
* ⚡ **The Human Side:** By day, I’m a **live captionist**. This role has trained me to listen hyper-carefully and process information instantly—skills that make me a precise and efficient engineer. Any work that brigns value to others  is what I deeply value and care about.
